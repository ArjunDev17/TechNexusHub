# MySQL Database Setup and User Privilege Management

This document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up MySQL databases and configuring user privileges on a MySQL server.

## Prerequisites
- You should have MySQL installed on a Windows machine. The version used in this example is MySQL 8.0.40 for Win64.
- You need administrative access to the MySQL server and the `root` user password.

### Step 1: Verify MySQL Version

To check the version of MySQL installed on your machine, open the command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
mysql --version
```

Example output:
```
mysql  Ver 8.0.40 for Win64 on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
```

### Step 2: Log in to MySQL

To log in to MySQL, use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

You will be prompted to enter the `root` user's password. After entering the password, you will be greeted with the MySQL prompt:

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 11
Server version: 8.0.40 MySQL Community Server - GPL
```

### Step 3: Show Existing Databases

Once logged in, you can list the existing databases by using the `SHOW DATABASES;` command:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

This will output a list of databases in the MySQL server:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

### Step 4: Create a New Database

To create a new database, use the `CREATE DATABASE` command. For example, to create a database named `Arjundb`, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Arjundb;
```

To confirm that the database was created, run `SHOW DATABASES;` again:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

You should now see the new database in the list:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| arjundb            |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

### Step 5: Create Another Database

You can create another database called `elec_store` by running the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE elec_store;
```

You can verify the creation of the database by running:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Step 6: Grant Privileges to a User

You can grant privileges to a user for a specific database. In this example, we grant `ALL PRIVILEGES` to the `root` user on the `elec_store` database.

However, there was an error in the original command due to incorrect syntax. The correct command to grant privileges without changing the password is:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON elec_store.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
```

If you intended to change the `root` user's password, you can run:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '9572@ssss';
```

### Step 7: Apply the Changes

To apply the privilege changes, you need to run the following command:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

This ensures that all privilege changes are refreshed and applied properly.

---

### Notes:
- The `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES` command grants full permissions (select, insert, update, delete, etc.) to the specified user (`root` in this case) on the specified database (`elec_store`).
- The `ALTER USER` command is used to modify the password of the specified user.
- The `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` command reloads the privilege tables to make sure all changes are applied.

---

### Conclusion

Following the steps above, you can set up MySQL databases, grant necessary privileges to users, and manage MySQL user accounts on a Windows machine.
