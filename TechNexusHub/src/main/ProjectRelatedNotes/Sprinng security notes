Authorization
Authentication
Authentication: This is the process of verifying someone's claimed identity. In the digital world, users prove their identity with credentials like usernames, passwords, security tokens, or even biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition).

Common methods:

Something the user knows: Username/password, PIN

Something the user has: Security key, phone for verification codes

Something the user is: Fingerprint, facial recognition

Authorization: This determines what level of access a user has to specific resources after they're authenticated. Imagine a company with different user roles:

Admins can access and edit everything.

Editors can edit content but not user accounts.

Regular users can only view content.

Key Differences

Focus: Authentication asks "who are you?" while authorization asks "what can you do?"

Timing: Authentication happens first, then authorization.

Visibility: Users often interact with authentication (login screen), while authorization happens behind the scenes.

Why are they important?

Together, authentication and authorization are crucial for computer security. They ensure only authorized users access specific resources, protecting sensitive information and functionalities.
